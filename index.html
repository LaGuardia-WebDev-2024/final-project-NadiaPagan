         On my bookshelf in my bedroom are books on Chanel and Dior nestled next to Jane Austen's Emma and stuck between my books on sewing. These three interests of mine, literature, fashion, and sewing, aren't just my aesthetic, they are part of who I am and I knew I wanted to continue exploring new creative disciplines. Therefore when I was applying to high schools my main criteria was the space where I would be able to hone and expand my artistic and creative skills. When I found LaGuardia's technical theater program I was over the moon. It had everything I wanted in a program and I would be able to try out an experiment with a bunch of new creative disciplines. LaGuardia's technical theater program explored sound, lighting, and costume design. Curriculum like this allowed me to explore all that technical theater had to offer. Freshman year we got to try all of it to figure out what we liked and what we wanted to focus on in later years. We would set up lighting plots  in the concert hall,build sets in our other theaters and sew costumes in our costume shop.As I got older I was able to take on more technical responsibilities. I will soon be allowed to be in charge of sewing, draping and designing my own costumes for characters. I would research a character and the time. They took place then I would meet with the actor playing that character to measure and drape the fabric on them so that I had a mock up of my costume and everything would fit just right.I also Took up a more management based role Backstage. I became a dresser and was in charge of making sure that my actor who I was assigned had  their costume on and everything with the costume was right.Although this may not seem like an incredibly important job it was. When dressers didn't do their job correctly it was evident. On one of the shows I was working on an actor had a quick change and had to change into Tearaway pants that would be torn away and reveal a different outfit but the dresser did not Check that he had put his costume on correctly and when the pants were torn away the actor was left in nothing but his underwear and a fat suit. Situations like this taught me the importance of problem solving, time management and being calm under stress.
So most of my experience of technical theater takes place at my school in the costume shop. I've also managed to work on off Broadway shows over the summer working as the props manager for a show.This experience taught me so much about managing money and keeping organized. There were a lot of different shows going on at the theater so I had to make sure everything had a place. We were also on a strict budget and I had to make sure that all the necessary props fit into the budget.
We're all working and technical theater has been a wonderful experience because it has helped me develop my important skills and has been a chance for me to explore new and exciting creative adventures.
